BI project for El-Al airline company. At the beginning of the project, the business questions and metrics (KPI's) were defined that guided the data retrieval process, performing ETL, and building an appropriate visual display with Power BI tool. We designed reports, dashboards and analytical tools for making data-based business decisions.

The repository contains 3 files:
1. Excel that containing the star schema with the data of the entities.
2. PowerBI file with the all dashboards and analytical reports. 
3. PDF file report summarizing the project objective, KPI's, conclusions and screenshots of the BI tools.
