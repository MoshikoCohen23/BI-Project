This project involved the development of a BI tool tailored for analyzing El-Al's data. From the outset, we established clear business objectives and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which steered the data retrieval process, the execution of Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations, and the creation of a dynamic visual representation using the Power BI tool. Our efforts culminated in the design of comprehensive reports, dashboards, and analytical tools aimed at facilitating data-driven business decisions. 

The repository contains 3 files:
1. Excel that containing the star schema with the data of the entities.
2. PowerBI file with the all dashboards and analytical reports. 
3. PDF file report summarizing the project objective, KPI's, conclusions and screenshots of the BI tools.
